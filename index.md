# Apache Spark and BigData

Spark is a general-purpose distributed data processing engine that is suitable for use in a wide range of circumstances. On top of the Spark core data processing engine, there are libraries for SQL, machine learning, graph computation, and stream processing, which can be used together in an application.

The below figure shows the core components that `spark` provides us.

```java

public class SparkApplication
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
