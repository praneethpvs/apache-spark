### Dropping the unnecessary columns from the dataframe which was constructed from `durham-parks.json`.

```java
df = df
    .drop ("fields")
    .drop ("geometry")
    .drop ("record_timestamp")
    .drop ("recordid")
    .drop ("datasetid")
    ;
```

The dataframe now constitutes the following data.
